On the homepage, list 9 cars by using the javascript’s “map/forEach” methods ( section “Featured cars” ).
Below “Featured cars” section, make a new section and name it “Car of the week”, by using the javascript’s “find” method, find a car with a name “Passat” and display it there.
Below “Featured cars” make a new section and name it “VW Cars” and by using the Javascript’s “filter” method list only the cars manufactured by VW.
Completely remove/clean “Latest blog posts” and “Testimonials” section.
In the “Contact us” section, when the clicked on “Send message” button get the values from the three input fields and display them in “alert”. For reference check : https://www.tabnine.com/academy/javascript/get-value-of-input/
